- NextJS bootstrapped with create-react-app/CRA
- Chakra UI
- The usual components everyone uses: Navbar, Footer, Default layout
- Dark mode/light mode with toggles already set up and ready to go

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm  run  dev
# or
yarn  dev
# or
pnpm  dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
